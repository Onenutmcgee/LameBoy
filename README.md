# LameBoy - The Lame GameBoy Emulator
This is a bad GameBoy emulator.  I'm using it to learn about writing emulators as well as using it to learn about SDL2 and creating live feedback for registers and program data. It will be written in C++ and developed in Visual Studio.  Windows will be the only supported platform.

# Goals of this Project
My goals for this project are as follows
  1. Create a functioning GameBoy emulator that can handle common cart functions, interrupts, and normal op codes
  2. Be reasonably accurate in timings 
  3. Be able to load and play commercial GameBoy games
  4. Be able to get real time feedback on the state of the program including CPU internal state and memory 
  5. Be able to step through programs at opcode level

# Stretch Goals
  1. Integrate audio support.  Many GameBoy emulators do not 
  2. Ability to sucessfully play through Pokemon Red/Blue
  3. GameBoy Color support

# Disclaimer
This software is not indended to be used by anybody.  This is just a personal project.  If you are looking for a GameBoy emulator to use, I would highly recommend VisualBoyAdvance.
